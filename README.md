# C/C++ Scanner Project

## Author
**Name:** Reem Ibrahim Abdullah Abdulghani Nassif

## Course Information
This project was developed as an assignment for the Compiler Design course at:  
**Institution:** Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Monofeya University

## Academic Supervision
- **Course Instructor:** Dr. Salah Shabaan
- **Teaching Assistant:** Eng. Ahmed Hesham Elqassas

## Project Overview
This project implements a lexical analyzer (scanner) for C/C++ source code. The scanner is capable of:
- Identifying and categorizing various C/C++ tokens
- Handling keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals
- Processing comments (single-line and multi-line)
- Recognizing preprocessor directives
- Maintaining line and column information for each token

## Key Features
- Complete C/C++ token recognition
- Support for standard library identifiers
- Comprehensive operator handling
- Robust comment processing
- Accurate source code position tracking
- String and character literal support
- Preprocessor directive handling

## Implementation Details
The scanner is implemented in C# and consists of several key components:
- `Scanner.cs`: Main lexical analyzer implementation
- `Token.cs`: Token representation class
- `TokenType.cs`: Enumeration of all supported token types
- `Program.cs`: Test program with sample code

## Testing
The implementation includes test cases for both simple and advanced C++ code samples, demonstrating the scanner's capability to handle various C/C++ language constructs.

## License
This project was developed for educational purposes as part of the Compiler Design course curriculum.
